DEV-BOON:

We are creating an extension which helps developers in increasing their productivity and also reduce their effort.
A lot of developers spend more time in fixing errors/searching on internet rather that real coding.
These days, we can see that a lot of developers are using youtube videos to refer rather that stackoverflow and other platforms.
So,We are trying to build an extension for VSCode which shows relevant videos/posts to users if they get any error/warnings etc.
For our module 1 and 2 :
    ->We Implemented the simple search model along with parser for stackoverflow and youtube.
    ->We Integrated the search model with VSCode and Implemented keybindings for user good experience.
    ->We Made User Interface for the youtube and stackoverflow Search queries by taking relevant parameters from a pool of parameters obtained from API.
